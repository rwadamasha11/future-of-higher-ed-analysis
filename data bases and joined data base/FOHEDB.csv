New dad with 2 boys under 3 years old.  If I'm not working you can catch me in hot yoga, boxing, boot camp, or a sound bath meditation class. (I live in LA of course I do yoga)  ✍️ What I'm currently working on:  I have a passion for working with school districts to find a solution to the problems they are facing. It allows me to shut up and listen to find what their pain points are.  I'm a big self-improvement person so I follow Tim Ferris/Tony Robbins Wheel of Life. It buckets the important areas of your life that you want to focus on.  Currently, work for an ed-tech company that went public within the last 60 days.  🎉 Fun facts  I grew up 20 miles from Chernobyl.   In 2013 I watched the Netflix movie Fat, Sick and Nearly Dead and started juicing fruits and veggies the same day. In total, I lost 90+ lbs over the course of a few years.  You can catch me always doing some sort of learning. I just finished up a speed reading course. Next on the list is a deep dive into Trusts/Estate Planning.  As I type this out, I'm on day 17 of a 21 day detox and down 22lbs.  Think and Grow Rich is my favorite book.  I practice real estate on the side and own a few properties in Los Angeles.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
